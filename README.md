# KiCad Python Plugin Collection

This repository contains a set of custom KiCad 9.0.4 plugins to automate common PCB tasks such as cleanup, backup, and metadata insertion. Each script is designed for easy operation and includes a toolbar button icon in the KiCad Application.

Why did I make this tool? Because deleting the existing tracks before running the auto-router was a hassle, so I made it possible to remove them all with a single click from an icon.
