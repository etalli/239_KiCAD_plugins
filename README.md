# KiCad Plugin Collection for KiCAD 9.0

This repository contains a set of custom KiCad 9.0.5 plugins to automate common PCB tasks such as cleanup, backup, and metadata insertion. Each script is designed for easy operation and includes a toolbar button icon in the KiCad Application.

Why did I make this tool? Because deleting existing wiring before running the auto-router was troublesome, so I made it possible to quickly operate with features like bulk deletion with a single click from an icon.
