# KiCad Python Plugin Collection

This repository contains a set of custom KiCad 9.0.4 plugins to automate common PCB tasks such as cleanup, backup, and metadata insertion. Each script is designed for easy operation and includes a toolbar button icon in the KiCad Application.

Why did I make this tool? Because deleting the existing tracks before running the auto-router was a hassle, so I made it possible to remove them all with a single click from an icon.

## Installation

### Method 1: Manual Installation

1. Open the plugins folder from the KiCAD application, Tools/Plugins folder, then copy all the python scripts and icons into the directory.  That's all.

### Method 2: Automated Installation with Makefile

For easier installation and management, you can use the included Makefile:

```bash
# Install all plugins and icons
make install

# Remove all installed plugins and icons
make clean
```

**Features:**
- âœ… Automatically copies all `.py` and `.png` files to the correct KiCAD plugins directory
- âœ… Shows installation status with file timestamps
- âœ… Safe clean operation that only removes files from this project
- âœ… Uses portable paths (works on any system)

**Requirements:**
- Make utility (usually pre-installed on macOS/Linux)
- KiCAD 9.0 installed in the default location

Good luck!
